Burst Search in FRETBursts
==========================

This section describes details and conventions used to implement burst
search in FRETBursts.

Defining the rate estimator
---------------------------

Before describing FRETBursts implementation let me introduce an expression
for computing rates of random events that will be used later on.
A general expression, used by FRETBursts (since version 0.5.6), for estimating
the rate using *m* consecutive timestamps is:

.. math::
    \hat{\lambda} = \frac{m - 1 - c}{t_{i + m - 1} - t_{i}}
    :label: ratedef

where :math:`c` is a parameter that can be passed to all FRETBursts functions
that deal with photon rates. Note that :math:`m` is the number of photons
and :math:`m - 1` is the number of inter-photon delays. For example,
using :math:`c=1`, yields an unbiased estimator of the rate for events
generated by a stationary Poisson process. See
`this notebook <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tritemio/notebooks/blob/master/Estimation%20of%20rates%20of%20random%20events.ipynb>`__
for a discussion of the different estimator properties as a function of
:math:`c`. In practice, the choice of :math:`c` is a convention and is provided
for flexibility and to match results of other software that may use a different
definition.

In FRETBursts version 0.5.5 or earlier, there is no
`c` parameter and the rate is always computed as
:math:`\hat{\lambda} = m / (t_{i + m - 1} - t_{i})`
(equivalent to :math:`c=-1`).

Conventions in burst search
---------------------------

Burst search is mainly performed calling the method
:meth:`Data.burst_search`. The AND-gate burst search function
(:meth:`fretbursts.burstlib_ext.burst_search_and`) calls
:meth:`Data.burst_search` under the hood, so all the considerations
below are also valid for the AND-gate version.

With :meth:`Data.burst_search`, you can perform burst search by setting
a "rate threshold" *F* times larger than the background rate (argument `F`),
or you can just set a single fixed rate for the full measurement
(argument `min_rate_cps`). In both cases the real burst search is performed
by the low-level function :func:`.phtools.burstsearch.bsearch_py`, which
takes as input parameters *m* and *T*. This function finds bursts
when a group of *m* consecutive photons lies within a *T* time window.
You can find an analysis of the algorithm implementation and performance
considerations in this
`blog post <http://tritemio.github.io/smbits/2015/12/06/optimize-burst-search-python/>`__.

When using the *F* argument, FRETBursts will choose the appropriate `T` for each
background period in order to obtain a "rate threshold"
*F times larger than background rate*. Practically, to compute *T*, FRETBursts
uses the expression (derived from :eq:`ratedef`):

.. math::
  T(t) = \frac{m - 1 - c}{F \cdot \hat{\lambda}_{bg}(t)}

where :math:`\hat{\lambda}_{bg}(t)` is the estimated background rate
as a function of time (:math:`t`).

Conversely, when directly fixing a rate with the argument
`min_rate_cps` (:math:`\lambda_{th}`), FRETBursts computes *T*
using the expression:

.. math::
  T = \frac{m - 1 - c}{\lambda_{th}}

The parameter :math:`c` can be specified when performing burst search.
When not specified, the default value of :math:`c=-1` is used.
This choice preserves backward compatibility with results obtained
with FRETBursts 0.5.5 or earlier.

.. _burstsearch_core:

The Core Algorithm
------------------

The different types of burst search described in the previous sections
are implemented calling the same low-level burst search function which
implements the core "sliding window" algorithm.
Here we explain in details this core algorithm.

The low-level burst search takes as an input the array of (monotonically
increasing) photon timestamps, as well as two other arguments *m*
(the number of timestamps) and *T* (the time window).
Starting from the the first element of the array,
we consider all the m-tuple of timestamps [0..m-1], [1..m], etc.

**Point 1.** For each m-tuple if the timestamps are contained in
a time window smaller or equal to *T* we mark a burst start at the position
of the first timestamp in the current m-tuple. Otherwise we take the next
m-tuple and repeat the check.

Once a burst starts we keep "sliding" the m-tuple one timestamp a time.
If the current m-tuple is still contained in a windows o duration *T*
the burst continues. When the current m-tuple is contained in a window
larger than *T* the burst ends. When this happens, the last timestamp
in a burst is the (m-1)-th timestamp of current m-tuple (i.e. the last
timestamps of the **previous**  m-tuple which was still contained in a
window *T*). After the burst ends we continue checking as in point 1
the next m-tuple, that is shifted by only one
timestamp (i.e. there is no jump when the burst ends).

At this point it can happen that the current m-tuple is contained in *T*
and a new burst starts right away. In this situation the new bursts will
have m-2 timestamps overlapping with the previous one.

At the end of the timestamp array, if a burst is currently started we end it
by marking the last timestamp as burst stop. The set of bursts obtained
in this way has the minimum-rate property, i.e. all the m-tuple of
consecutive timestamps in any burst are guaranteed to be contained in a
windows *T* or smaller. Conversely, a few bursts will overlap and thus share
some timestamps. If the user wants to avoid overlapping bursts a
burst fusion steps must be applied as described in next section. Note,
however, that after fusing overlapping bursts at least one m-tuple
inside each fused burst will not have the minimum-rate property, i.e.
the m-tuple is contained in a window larger than *T*.

.. py:currentmodule:: fretbursts

The previous function is implemented in :func:`phtools.burstsearch.bsearch_py`
(pure python version) and in :func:`phtools.burstsearch_c.bsearch_c`
(optimized cython version). Several tests make sure that the two functions
return numerically identical results. An analysis of performance of
of different implementations can be found in this blog post:
`Optimizing burst search in python <http://tritemio.github.io/smbits/2015/12/06/optimize-burst-search-python/>`__.

Burst Fusion
------------

Burst fusion is an operation which fuses consecutive bursts if the
start of the second bursts minus the end of the first burst
(called burst separation) is <=
of a fusion time :math:`t_f`. When bursts are overlapping (see previous
section) the burst separation is negative. Therefore, to avoid
overlapping bursts, we need to apply fusion with separation of 0.
Note that with this condition, if a bursts ends on a timestamp which
is the start of the next burst (i.e. 1 overlapping photon) the two
bursts will be fused. Conversely if one burst ends and the next burst
starts one photon later (0 overlapping photons) the two bursts will
be kept separated. In this latter case there will be no timestamp
between the end of the previous burst and the start of the next one.

.. py:currentmodule:: fretbursts.burstlib

To perform burst fusion use the method :meth:`Data.fuse_bursts`.
